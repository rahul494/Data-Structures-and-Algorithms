# AlgoExpert - Balanced Brackets

# Write a function that takes in a string made up of brackets '(', '{', '[', ')', '}', ']'
# and other optional characters. The function should return a
# boolean representing whether the string is balanced with regards to brackets.


# A string is said to be balanced if it has as many opening brackets of a
# certain type as it has closing brackets of that type and if no bracket is
# unmatched. Note that an opening bracket can't match a corresponding closing
# bracket that comes before it, and similarly, a closing bracket can't match a
# corresponding opening bracket that comes after it. Also, brackets can't
# overlap each other as in '[(])'

# Sample Input:

#     string = "([])(){}(())()()"

# Sample Output: 

#     true
